1. Download the hotel data from the website kaggle. There are three datasets:

    ~OR~

    Download (i) and (ii) from the zip code file and only download (iii) from the website.

2. Save these files in your in the same file directory and name them respectively as csv files:

3. Ensure the photo "hotel2.png" is downloaded and in the current working directory.

4. Ensure your current working directory is the same location as the files saved above.
